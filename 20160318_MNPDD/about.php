Hi there! I am Michael Nguyen, a freelance photographer, graphic designer, and web developer based in SoCal. With an educational background in multi-platform software development and over 10 years working experience in the corporate world as a photographer and software development manager, I have learned that without passion, there is no desire for greatness. As your consultant, my greatest achievement will be to see you succeed and this is accomplished by making your vision into a reality.
